This repository contains all the Jupyter Notebooks, datasets, images, video presentations, and the source materials/references used and created as part of the Mini Project for SC1015: Introduction to Data Science and AI. The project undertaken is the detection of Phishing URLs.

This README briefly highlights what we have accomplished in this project. If you want a more detailed explanation of things, please refer to the the Jupyter Notebooks in this repository. They contain more in-depth descriptions and smaller details which are not mentioned here in the README. For convenience, we have divided the notebooks into 5 parts which broadly relate to the 5 main sections of this project.
